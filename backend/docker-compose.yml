# docker-compose up -d to start the containers
# then you have to inspect the container running postgress and get the ip address
# docker inspect postgres_container_id
# then you can open browser and go to http://localhost:5050
# login with the credentials you set in the docker-compose file
# then you can add a new server
# host name is the ip address you got from inspecting the postgres container
# username and password are the ones you set in the docker-compose file
# then you can create a new database
# Now use that name and credentials in your strapi project
